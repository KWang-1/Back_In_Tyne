# Back_In_Tyne
Tour guide app for historical sites in Northumbria (Group project coursework).

This app takes in two xml file named "site_data.xml" and "event_data.xml". These files are parsed at run-time to provide the content to be presented by the app.

The app uses a navigation bar system, with the four main pages instantly accessible from anywhere in the app.

The main page shows an introduction to the app, hyperlinked cycling cards for each of the sites, as well as links to the other pages.

The primary feature of the app is the map page, which displays an interactive map with each of the sites marked on as pins. These pins can be clicked on to show a title, image, and short description of the site.
If the expanded pin is clicked on again, the app will show the full content page for that site, including full details such as full description, accessibility, address, and a picture gallery.

There is also a search page that allows you to you search through all of the sites, filtering by name, and/or by location type.

An events page shows a list of all the different events that are going on.

The settings page provides some accessibility options, as well as the ability to contact the developers.
