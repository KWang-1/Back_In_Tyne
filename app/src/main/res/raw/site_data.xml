		<introduction>Marking the beginning of the Viking Raids on England this Priory’s key location upon Holy Island led it to hold a rich story of British Catholic and Secular history.  </introduction>
        <description>In 1542, following Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries a fort was ordered to be built near the recently closed Lindisfarne monastery. Many of the stones there today were originally part of the monastery.
Between 1570 and 1571, Elizabeth I updated and strengthened the defences, adding new gun platforms.  Following the ascension of James I and combination of the English and Scottish thrones the need for border castles declined .
In 1903, the architect Edward Lutyens refurbished the castle into a grand holiday home for the publishing magnate Edward Hudson.

        <type>Fort</type>
		<introduction>Serving as the main sea route to Hadrian’s wall this fort was a key military supply base for north Britanniae. This fort derives its name from the Arabic, mesopotamian troops that garrisoned its walls. </introduction>
        <description>Arbeia was a Roman fort built around 160AD. Standing above the entrance to the River Tyne, Arbeia Fort guarded the main sea route to Hadrian's Wall. It was a key garrison and military supply base to other forts along the Wall and is an important part of the history of Roman Britain.
The name Arbeia means "fort of the Arab troops", referring to the fact that part of its garrison at one time was a squadron of Mesopotamian boatmen from the Tigris.
Through the course of history Arbeia has had several guises; from the Roman Emperor's HQ for the Scottish invasion to a busy cosmopolitan port. It was a huge supply base for the Roman army, home to 600 Roman troops and is said to be the birth place of the Northumbrian King Oswin.

        <description>On this site, on 9th September 1513 the battle of Flodden Field was fought between the Scottish and English thrones.
Following Henry VIII’s declaration of war with France, Scotland’s James IV launched a campaign to support their ally by distracting the English and invading the north. Henry’s veteran military commander Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey fought and defeated the Scots, killing James and routing the Scottish force.
This battle cowed the Scots into submission and 90 years later the crowns of Scotland and England were unified.

			<era>Medieval</era>
			<type>Castle</type>
			<introduction>This castle’s history stretches as far back as the Celtic Britons, through Norman Conquests, Lancastrians holdouts and WW2 defenses this castle’s story is as rich and varied as England’s itself.</introduction>
			<description>The initial structure of this site was a fort of the indigenous Celtic Britons known as Din Guarie and may have been the capital of the kingdom of Bernicia.
Following William the Conqueror's invasion in 1066 the Normans built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one.
During the Wars of the Roses, Bamburgh was one of four castles held by the Lancastrians in the north. These four castles enabled the Lancastrians to secure control of the Eastern March ensuring they could seek support from Scotland and provide a secure landing place for foreign mercenaries. In 1464, following a nine month siege, it became the first castle in England to be defeated through the use of artillery.
In the second world war pillboxes were established in the sand dunes near the castle in fear of a Nazi invasion.

				<name>Warkworth Castle</name>
				<address>Warkworth Castle
							Warkworth
							Northumberland
							NE65 0UJ
							</address>
				<era>Medieval</era>
				<type>Castle</type>
				<introduction>This striking cross shaped castle towers above the village below. From it’s construction in 1200 this castle has been the home of the powerful Northern, Percy family. Featuring in Shakespear’s productions and captured by Catholic rebels this castle has been a centrepiece to a number of Northern English conflicts.</introduction>
				<description>A flimsy timber castle was the first structure upon this site, thought to be built during the reign of king Henry II.
The castle was probably laid out in its present form in about 1200 and was the favoured residence of the powerful Percy family from the 14th to the 17th centuries. As the Earls (and later Dukes) of Northumberland, they were among the greatest landowners in northern England.
In the Rising of the North the castle was captured by Catholic noble rebels. The castle always appears as a backdrop in Shakespeare’s Henry IV.
The details surrounding Warkworth Castle's role in the English Civil War are unclear, but the conflict resulted in further damage to the structure. Initially held by Royalist forces, the castle was still important enough that when the Scots invaded in 1644 they forced its surrender.
Fun fact
Nearby, on the banks of the river Coquet and accessible only by boat, are the remains of a chapel known as the hermitage, carved directly out of the cliff rock.

			<type>Fort</type>
			<introduction>Guarding the bridge over the river Tyne and  housing Roman soldiers from present day Germany, Bonia and Croatia this fort was a key location protecting Hadrian’s wall from barbarian raids from the north.</introduction>
			<description>Chester’s is one of a series of permanent forts built during the construction of Hadrian’s Wall. The cavalry fort, known to the Romans as Cilurnum, was built in about AD 124.
The site guarded a bridge, Chester’s Bridge, carrying the Military Way Roman road behind the wall across the River North Tyne. Massive abutments survive of this bridge across the river from the fort. Cilurnum was a cavalry fort at its foundation, for retaliatory raids into barbarian areas north of the wall, then given over to infantry later. It was occupied until the Romans left Britain in the 5th century.
Pioneering excavations in the 19th century exposed the structures visible today. These excavations yielded one of the best collections of inscriptions and sculpture on Hadrian’s Wall.

		<introduction>Composing of nine forts as well as baths and a village this auxiliary fort complex predates the construction of Hadrian’s wall and guardes a crossing over the river Tyne.</introduction>
        <description>Vindolanda was a roman auxiliary fort predating construction of Hadrian’s wall. Occupied between 85-370AD. The fort guarded the Stanegate, the Roman road from the River Tyne to the Solway Firth.
The site itself comprises nine forts built on top of each other. Soldiers from all over the Roman Empire, including Belgium, Germany and France were garrisoned here. The visible stone fort dates to the third century and the impressive remains include the fort walls, the headquarters building, the Commanding Officer’s house, granaries and barracks. Extensive remains of the extramural settlement lie just west of the fort with buildings lining a main street. These include houses, shops, a tavern and a bath house.

		<introduction>Marking the beginning of the Viking Raids on England this Priory’s key location upon Holy Island led it to hold a rich story of British Catholic and Secular history.</introduction>
        <description>Lindisfarne Priory was founded by St Aidan in AD 635. The great Northumbrian holy man St Cuthbert, lived and died here in 670.
Lindisfarne was the site of the first ever Viking invasion of the British isles, in 793 signalling the beginning of the ‘Viking Age’. Following the collapse of the Northumbrian Kingdom in 875 the monks fled the island, taking the bones of St Cuthbert with them.  The priory was re-established by the Normans in 1093 when they built a castle on the island.
In 1536 the priory was disestablished following Henry VII’s break from the Catholic church in Rome. At this point many stones from the monastery were used to build the neighbouring Lindisfarne Castle.

		<introduction>Sitting at the mouth of the River Tyne this castle and priory served as the backdrop to Christopher Marlowe’s work and served as a key defensive location in the defense of Britain in the second world war.</introduction>
        <description>The priory was founded early in the 7th century.
Notably Oswin, King of Deria was buried there in 651.  In The Danes attacked the Priory in 800 the Priory was attacked by the Danish raiders, following a third attack in 865 the castle and priory were destroyed.
In 1296 a stone wall was erected with a gatehouse and barbican added in 1390.  In 1312 King Edward II took refuge in this castle, an event dramatized in Christopher Marlowe’s Edward II where the castle is used as a backdrop in Act II.
At the end of the 19th century the castle became used as a barracks, in World War II the castle became part of the coastal defence installations covering the mouth of the river Tyne. A gun emplacement was built within the Priory precinct and can still be seen by visitors today.
